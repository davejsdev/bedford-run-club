# About Bedford Run Club

Bedford Run Club is a community of individuals brought together by running, socializing, and beer!

The Bedford Run Club meets every Tuesday at the Garrison Seaport Brewery at 6pm! There’s nothing fancy to our group, just some sweat and a good time.

All runners of all skill levels are welcome.

## Why is it called Bedford Run Club when it’s not even in Bedford?

Bedford Run Club first started in Bedford by a group of Bedford-born runners. Growing up running the streets of Bedford, they always joked that one day they would start their own run club and during the pandemic, BRC was born.

BRC started running in Halifax in 2022 when several of the founding members moved to the South End and we're been running Point Pleasant Park ever since.

## When was the club started?

Started in 2021 in Bedford as an outlet to socialize with friends and promote cardiovascular health during a global pandemic that keep many indoors. The first season of Bedford Run Club featured runs in Bedford, Sackville, Halifax, and Mount Uniacke with an irregular schedule and varying distances.

The following season of 2022, the Tuesday runs commensed in April where 5 runners ran the inaugural Halifax route. The route, day and time haven’t changed since then.

BRC has hosted over 200 runners in the past 4 years, many committed to the weekly grind and are well known around the club.

In 2023, due to popular demand and a shared drive to train for running events in the cold winter months, we kept BRC going throughout the winter, meeting at the Oval instead of Garrison Brewery.

## I’m new to running, is BRC for me?

Definitely! Bedford Run Club fosters an inclusive group of runners of all levels. BRC runs a 5k and a 7k loop to accommodate all runners.

## I’m really slow, should I not even bother?

If this is your mindset, you will miss out on a great community that works hard to be better everyday, regardless of pace, distance or time. There is no finish line at BRC, so there’s no pressure. Join an amazing group of individuals for good laughs and a good sweat, we would love to have you.

We also have a variety of paces usually ranging from 4:30/km to 6:30/km, and we always meet back at Garrison Brewery to socialize afterwards.
